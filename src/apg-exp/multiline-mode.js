// Unlike most `regex` engines, `apg-exp` has no multiline mode.
// `apg-exp` makes no assumptions about what is or isn't a line boundary.
// Nonetheless, it is very easy to create line-boundary anchors, once you have decided
// what constitutes the set of line-ending characters or character combinations.
//Line boundary anchors can be created with the look around operators.
// A line must be preceded by a line-end or the beginning of the string
// and followed by a line-end or the end of string.
//You can see how these anchors are created in the grammar below.
//
// This example will demonstrate finding defined strings but only if they constitute an entire line.
// Using the global `g` flag and user-defined line ends, we can easily mimic the multiline mode
// supported by most `regex` engines.
//
// This example will consider the carriage return (CR) and new line (LF) characters as line ends
// as well as the combination CRLF.
