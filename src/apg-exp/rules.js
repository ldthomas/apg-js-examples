// This module demonstrates how to deal with the phrases matched to the SABNF syntax rule names.
// Rule names are similar to named groupings in `regex` expressions. They associate a name with a phrase.
// `apg-exp` provides a little more information about the rule phrases than does the JavaScript `RegExp` object.
// Firstly, the JavaScript `RegExp` object does not provide for naming the grouped phrases, although other flavors
// of `regex` engines do. Secondly, the JavaScript `RegExp` object only gives the last match to the group and doesn't
// provide the character index where it was found. `apg-exp` retains all phrases matched by any rule name and provides
// character index where it was found.
//
// The `result` object retains an array of all of the phrases found for each rule name.
// It is an array of phrase objects, each object having the phrase and index in the form
// {phrase: string, index : number}.
// By default, all rule names in the grammar are retained in the result object
// but, as will be demonstrated here, uninteresting rules or phrases can be ignored.
//
// The [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)
// description of the `RegExp` object also indicates that it retains "last match" information.
// Although most of that information seems to be missing in the `node.js` implementation, all of it,
// including the aliases, are defined and retained by the `apg-exp` object.
// This will also be demonstrated here.
//
// We will pick a grammar and string that will have several named-rules, some with zero, one and more matching phrases.
// This is a simplified [`ini file`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) format.
// It simply consists of a single, optional section name line and one required key/pair line.
// Because of the many line end characters, we will use HTML display of the results.
// The line end characters leave many confusing gaps in the console output.
