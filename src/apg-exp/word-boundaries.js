// Unlike most `regex` engines, `apg-exp` has no built-in notation for word boundaries.
// `apg-exp` makes no assumptions about what is or isn't a word boundary.
// Nonetheless, it is very easy to create word-boundary anchors, once you have decided
// what constitutes a word.
//
// This example will demonstrate matching words which consist only of ASCII alphabetic characters.
// Once this word character set has been defined, word boundary anchors can be created
// with the look around operators. A word must be preceded by a non-word character or the beginning of the string
// and followed by a non-word character or the end of string. You can see how these anchors are created
// in the grammar below.
//
// This example will show the word "cat" is matched at the beginning of a line, in the middle of the line
// and at the end of the line. However, the character string "cat" is not found as a word when part of a longer string,
// in this case in the words "Bobcat" and "caterpillar".
