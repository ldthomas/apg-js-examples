// This module addresses the problem of matching the fields in Microsoft's Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.
// This problem is addressed in Jeffrey Friedl's book *Mastering Regular Expressions*, pg. 213
// and you can compare this solution to his discussion there.
//
// Two separate approaches are taken.
// The first is to define a grammar that will match only one field, and then find them all in a loop with the global flag set.
// The second is to define a grammar that scoops up all fields in one fell swoop.
//
// The Microsoft format calls for escaping a quote within a quoted string by using a pair of quotes.
// Therefore, this is not entirely just a pattern matching problem.
// Regardless of whether using `regex` or `apg-exp`,
// a replacement process (translation) must follow the pattern matching (parsing) process.
// In this simple case, it is easiest to just use the built-in, JavaScript string replacement functions.
// However, I will also show how it can be almost as easily done with `apg-exp`.
// The only thing that makes `apg-exp` slightly more inconvenient is that it is not built into the JavaScript language.

    // The advantage here is that we get all of the raw comma-separated fields in a single array.
    // In this case `result.rules['field']` is an array of phrase objects. i.e. `{phrase : string, index : number}`.
    // The disadvantage is that we have to remove the surrounding quotes as well as replace the
    // interior pairs of quotes in separate steps.
    // It also points out a weakness in the `apg-exp result` format.
    // Even though it is more complete than its JavaScript `RegExp` counterpart in that it has all
    // of the matched phrases for each rule (`RegExp` grouping) instead of just the last one matched,
    // there is no easy way to associate which `result.rules['quoted-text']` belongs to which
    // `result.rules['field']`.
    // (We could do this with a translation of the `exp.ast` object, but that is for another time and place.)
